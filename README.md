## Overview

The **FastStop** plugin is designed for PocketMine-MP servers to apply various effects and restrict player actions during server updates. This plugin ensures that players cannot perform certain actions and receive effects to inform them of the update status. The plugin is highly customizable through its configuration file.

## Features

- **Apply Custom Effects:** Customize the effects applied to players during server updates.
- **Restrict Player Actions:** Prevent players from moving, interacting with blocks, placing or breaking blocks, and taking or causing damage.
- **Configurable Messaging:** Choose from different message types (title, tip, or chat message) to inform players of the update status.
- **Message Cooldown:** Set a cooldown to prevent message spam.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin zip file.
2. Unzip the file and put it in the `plugins` directory of your PocketMine-MP server.
3. Restart the server to load the plugin.
4. 
## Commands 

1. /faststop on: Enables FastStop mode, applying effects to all players and restricting actions.
2. /faststop off: Disables FastStop mode, removing effects from all players and lifting restrictions.
3. /faststop add PlayerName: removing effects from the player and lifting restrictions for him/her.
